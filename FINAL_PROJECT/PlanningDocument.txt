Planning Document 

(a) testing strategy 

Test question propogation to user
Test correct answer
Test that correct/incorrect answer cues the right response (correct! moves to next question immediately
incorrect! explains why, then moves to next)

Test timer functionality (taking too long to answer->die; answering too many incorrectly->die; answering
							enough correct->success)
Test random selection of questions

(b) your development strategy (not in order)
1) Writing questions (will be read in as input file)
2) Logic for testing challenge answer system and for calculating end result/next steps
3) Make fraction class
4) GUI development
5) Question class to store question data read in from file
6) Timer 
7) Game control enum (0,1,2 correspond to game over, game won, game in play)

//Test that questions are selected randomly and that the answers are ordered randomly
